\subsection*{MTBF and MTTF}

%======================================================================================================= %
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean time between failures (MTBF) is the predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a system during operation.
\item MTBF can be calculated as the arithmetic mean (average) time between failures of a system.
\item The MTBF is typically part of a model that assumes the failed system is immediately repaired (mean time to repair, or MTTR), as a part of a renewal process. 
\item This is in contrast to the mean time to failure (MTTF), which measures average time to failures with the modeling assumption that the failed system is not repaired (infinite repair time).
\item The definition of MTBF depends on the definition of what is considered a system failure. For complex, repairable systems, failures are considered to be those out of design conditions which place the system out of service and into a state for repair. 
\item Failures which occur that can be left or maintained in an unrepaired condition, and do not place the system out of service, are not considered failures under this definition.
\item In addition, units that are taken down for routine scheduled maintenance or inventory control are not considered within the definition of failure.
