Hazard Probability 
=========================
- In the medical world, doctors often want to understand which treatments help patients survive 
longer – and which have no effect at all (or worse). In the business world, the equivalent 
concern is when customers stop. 
- This is particularly true of businesses that have a well-defined 
beginning and end to the customer relationship – subscription-based relationships. These 
relationships are found in a wide range of industries, such as insurance, communication, cable 
televisions, newspaper/magazine subscription, banking, and electricity providers in competitive 
markets. 
- The basis of survival data mining is the hazard probability, the chance that someone who has 
survived for a certain length of time (called the customer tenure) is going to stop, cancel, or 
expire before the next unit of time. 
- This definition assumes that time is discrete, and such 
discrete time intervals – whether days, weeks, or months – often fits business needs. By 
contrast, traditional survival analysis in statistics usually assumes that time is continuous.
