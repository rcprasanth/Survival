Quantifying Survival 
=======================
Survival does more than show the difference between groups of customers. It makes it possible 
to quantify the difference between groups. The chart in Figure 3 illustrates one common 
measure, the customer half-life (or median customer lifetime). This is the tenure where exactly 
half the original customers would still be expected to be active. The calculation is quite easy. 
The vertical axis has the survival values. Follow the 50% line over until it hits the survival 
curve. This is the tenure where half the customers survive.
