Kaplan-Meier
====================
The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a very useful tool for estimating survival functions. Sometimes, we may want to
make more assumptions that allow us to model the data in
more detail. By specifying a parametric form for S(t), we can
- easily compute selected quantiles of the distribution
- estimate the expected failure time
- derive a concise equation and smooth function for estimating S(t), H(t) and h(t)
- estimate S(t) more precisely than KM assuming theparametric form is correct!
